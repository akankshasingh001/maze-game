//Build a maze algorithm

1. Create a grid of 'cells'
2. Pick a random starting cell
3. For that cell, build a randomly-ordered list of neighbours
4. If a neighbour has been visited before,remove it from the list.
5. For each remaining neighbour, 'move' to it and remove the wall between those two cells.
6. Repeat for this new neighbour.(for step 3).

//For grid generate:
1. Create 2D array which has 3 columns and 3 rows.(have starting value false)
array = [
    [false,false,false],
    [false,false,false],
    [false,false,false]
]

//For Vertical generate:(have starting value false)
1. Create 2D array which has 3 rows and 2 columns.
array = [
    [false,false],
    [false,false],
    [false,false]
]

//For Horizonatl generate:(have starting value false)
1. Create 2D array which has 2 rows and 3 columns.
array = [
    [false,false,false],
    [false,false,false]
]
